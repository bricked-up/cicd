#+title: CI/CD Pipeline

Cicd handles webhook requests from Github and rebuilds the backend service. Only ~push~ webhooks are accepted on the master branch.

* Build
#+begin_src shell
  go build
#+end_src

* Usage
#+begin_src shell
  ./cicd
#+end_src

For more information:
#+begin_src shell
  ./cicd -h
#+end_src

** Flags
- port
- secret
- config

* Configuration
When you run the program for the first time, a default configuration file will be created. You can specify any number of ~Actions~ as you desire. Each ~Action~ determines how to handle a specific endpoint. See the comments in the configuration file for more details on all the options.

*NOTE*: If no script is provided, a successful webhook processing will print out a simple message to the console.
